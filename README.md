# Treatment-for-Influenza---cost-effectiveness-analysis---tree-plot

Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using Abraxane as a treatment option for advanced pancreatic cancer, compared to providing Taxol, from a healthcare provider's perspective: A decision tree

Methods:
- Study Design: The decision tree model was constructed using R programming language, with several packages including ggplot2, lattice, caret, rpart, rpart.plot, and reshape2. 
- The input parameters were defined in a data frame that includes:
/- probability of adverse reactions
-- probability of being cured
-- life years gained or lost
-- costs of treatment
-- costs of adverse reactions
-- willingness to pay per life year gained
- Population: Patients with pancreatic cancer (N=28)
